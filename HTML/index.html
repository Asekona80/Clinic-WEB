    You can collect your prescribed medicines conveniently from our clinic pharmacy. We offer vaccinations for children and adults, including flu shots and COVID-19 vaccines. For mothers-to-be, we provide prenatal care and support during pregnancy and childbirth.

    We also help manage chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and asthma with regular check-ups and advice. Our mental health support services offer a listening ear and counseling for individuals and families. We conduct basic lab tests right at the clinic, saving you the need to travel far. And because we believe in healthy living, we run community health talks to share knowledge and support a better lifestyle for everyone.
